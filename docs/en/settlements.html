            <p class = "single-text-article">
                Luzhitsy is the oldest Votic village, which remains one of the few places where Votes still live compactly,
                and, therefore, is the cultural center of the people. The village's age is estimated as more than 500 years old.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The name of the village came from the location on the river Luzhitsa.
                It was first mentioned in scribe roll of Vodskaya (Votic) Pyatina, 1500,
                as village Luzhitsy by the Ust-Luga gulf in Nikolsky-Toldozhsky churchyard in the territory of Yamburg district.

            </p>
            <p class = "single-text-article">
                The village arose as a result of the merging of two adjacent villages: Pesky and Nizhniye Luzhitsy.
                The current appearance of Luzhitsy is very different even from that
                of some 70 years ago, not to mention times more ancient.

                The center of the village was marked by a chapel.
                There was a road that ran past the chapel towards the sea, along which cattle were driven to pasture.
                The street that formed along this road was named Progonny End (Driving End).

                On the basis of the Museum, work was started on collecting ethnographic material, collecting and systematizing information,

                When the border of the village crossed the river,

                In 1742, Pillovo, as well as Volosovo, and a Large Radilovo passed into the possession of count A. G. Razumovsky.
                Legend has it that on the advice of a groom, the count cured the inflammation by constantly washing them in the waters of a spring.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                In gratitude, on the site of the old wooden chapel under a thatched roof, the count put a new chapel in stone.
                Every year until 1937 from the temple in the village of Kotly through the villages of Pumalitsy, Rannolovo,
                Pillovo to the chapel there was a procession with a water sacrament which was performed in the stream.
