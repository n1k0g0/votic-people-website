                Vađđa is the oldest known tribe of the North-West of the Leningrad region.
                For a long time it was believed that Votes appeared on these lands only at the end of the first Millennium A.D.
                and the roots of this people lie in Estonia.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                However, according to the latest archaeological data, the earliest discovered Vodic burials date back to the I-IV centuries A.D.
                On stone burial platforms located near the villages of Valgovitsy and Velikino,
                various household items of the ancestors of modern Votes were found: iron and bronze bracelets, breast pins, a Celt axe, fragments of a scythe-pink salmon and fragments of ceramics.
            </p>
            <p class = "single-text-article">
                There are not many chronicles describing Votes left.
                Since the Votic people lived on the outskirts of Novgorod possessions,
                the chronicles mostly mark only the most significant events: disasters, wars, etc.
                According to them, one can understand only some aspects of the life of medieval Votes.
                Very often Vađđa is mentioned in the description of the military conflicts that affect the interests of Ancient Novgorod.

            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                For instance, the Novgorod first chronicle reports,
                that on October 23, 1069, when the Novgorodians won a victory over Prince Vseslav of Polotsk, on whose side the Votes came out.
                In this message, historians see the desire of vodi to free itself from the intention of Novgorod to extend tribute to it.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                In 1149, Votes with the help of 500 Novgorodians, exterminated 1000 people from the Finnish Yem (Jäämit) tribe who attacked them.
                It should be noted that, despite the mutual assistance of Novgorodians and Votians,
                the increasing power of Novgorod over Vađđa  was quite severe.
                After the German attack on Votes in 1240 and their founding of the "city in Koporye Pogost"
                Alexander Nevsky took Koporye fortification a year later.
                Traitors from Votes and Chud were hanged by order of the Prince,
                and some of the captured Germans were released.

                By the XIII century, the inclusion of the land of Votes in the Novgorod possessions was completed.
                In the Charter of Prince Yaroslav (1260s) was first named among the 9 main districts of Novgorod
                of the earth "Votic Sotnya".
                In 1270 and 1316, the Votes fought together with the Novgorodians — this time against the princes they did not like.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                In 1478, when Novgorod was conquered by Ivan III and all Novgorod's possessions were divided into pyatinas,
                one of the pyatinas was called Votic,
                although its borders went far beyond the boundaries of the ancient Votic land, even capturing Karelia.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The transition to the rule of Novgorod had the consequence of the adoption of Christianity in the form of Orthodoxy by the Votians.
                In the XIII century Votic Pyatina was already a stable part of the Novgorod Republic,
                and the Votic militia is part of the Novgorod one.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                Written sources do not give an exact localization of the settlement of Votes.
                The first sources of this kind are scribal books,
                compiled after the annexation of Novgorod to Moscow (for example, the Scribe book of Dmitry Kitaev's Votic Pyatina, 7008);
                however, these books were compiled after the redistribution of Novgorod lands by the Moscow authorities
                and may not correspond to the naturally occurring way of life.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                According to many researchers, the medieval Votians were spread between the Luga and Izhora lands,
                and in the West it approached the Luga river, except for the actual river bank.
                Apparently,the sea coast from the mouth of the Luga to the Sista river was not part of the Votic Pyatina,
                where medieval sources place Chud.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The assimilation of Votes by the Slavic people (who migrated to the area of its settlement from the South)
                and Izhora (who migrated from the North-East) population led to a reduction in its number.
                In 1444-1447, the Livonian knights kidnapped a significant group of Votes near Bausk (modern Latvia),
                where the descendants of the settlers remained as a separate ethnic group called the Krevings until the middle of the XIX century.

                however, there is evidence that part of Votes who lived in the area of Kotly on fertile land that gave excellent harvests,
                was subjected to forced relocation due to collectivization.

                In the same month, the evacuation of local Finno-speaking peoples began, first to Estonia,
                to the city of Paldiski (in Soviet times – Baltiysk), and then to Finland.

                In 1997, the first Votic Museum was established in the village of Luzhitsy.
                70 exhibits were collected in the Museum by T. Efimova and other villagers
                as well as more than 200 photos of the pre-war period. The Museum started collecting ethnographic material,
                collecting and structuring the information from various archives, including information on the genealogy of Votic families, etc.
                Since 2000, an annual holiday is held in the village of Luzica "Luutsa vakkavõ" - "Luzica fold".
