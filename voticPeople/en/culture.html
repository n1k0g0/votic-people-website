                In ethnographic literature, Votic women are often credited with an unusually beautiful appearance, as well as a cheerful and pleasant character.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                At the end of the XVIII century the famous Russian Explorer Fyodor Tumansky wrote about votians literally the following:
                "Chud women are all generally beautiful, have a cheerful, pleasant and alluring look, quick eyes, big and blue...".
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The historian Heinrich Gabriel Portan also recognized that Votic women are considered more beautiful than Russian and Finnish.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                In the manuscript of F. Tumansky, such features of Votes are given as
                "a very sharp mind, a quick concept, and a strong desire for war»,
                at the same time, they " always remember their antiquity and strength...
                They remember with admiration that their ancestors were brave."

                From the scribal books of the 16th century we can find out that rye, oats and barley, flax and hemp were sown on these lands,

                Votes plowed wwith plows “Adra”, the plough appeared only from the XIX century. As long as to the 1940s, crops were harvested with a serrated edge.
                Bread before threshing was dried in special "Rehi" shed building.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                A prominent place in the life of the Votians was marine fishing, and in those villages
                which were located directly on the shores of the Gulf of Finland,
                this fishery was particularly developed.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                By the beginning of the 20th century, the village of Valgovitsy was famous for making wooden plates, wheels and spinning wheels.
                Vađđa was also famous for its stove-makers: the villages of Ilkovo, Raikovo and Semeyskoe were inhabited almost entirely by craftsmen,
                who worked in Votic and neighboring Izhorian villages.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                In the villages of Ivanovskoye and Velikino, they were also engaged in carriage.

                The Votes lived in multi-yard villages, in huts of the East Slavic type.
                The basis of their diet was bread made from rye flour, which was baked in the form of high round loaves.
                Cereals were boiled from barley, milk was curdled milk and cottage cheese was made too.

                Phonetically, the Votic language, along with other Baltic-Finnish languages, has a rich set of vowel sounds,
                which is divided into vowels of the front row (ä, ö, ü, e), the back row (a, o, u, õ), neutral i, and the i̮ vowel, which is
                used only in Russian loanwords
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                In addition, the Votic language is characterized by a rich set of diphthongs (29 in total).
                The main emphasis is placed on the first syllable; additional - on each odd, starting from the beginning of the word.
                Vowel harmony is present, however, the vowels i and i̮ do not extend harmony.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                The following parts of speech are distinguished in the Votic language: noun, adjective, numeral,
                pronoun, adverb, verb, preposition, postposition, union, particle, interjection.
                The declined parts of speech vary in fourteen cases.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                As well as in other Uralic languages, possessive suffixes were previously present in Votic (for example, poika “son” - poikano “your son”),
                however, in the modern language they are no longer used, preserved only in folklore.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The verb in the Votic language has the following categories: face, number, time, mood.
                The tense category of the verb is expressed in the form of the present, future, and three past tenses
                (actual past, perfection, plussquamperfect)

                Most of the vocabulary of the Voda language is based on the pre-Baltic-Finnish language,
                including common for all Baltic-Finnish languages loanwords from Baltic, Germanic and Slavic languages.
                There are also loanwords from Izhorian, Finnish and especially Russian languages presented: kormuna “pocket”, starikka “old man”, ďeda “grandfather”.

                Now let's turn to the XVIII - early XIX century - it was at this time that the first ethnographic descriptions of Votic clothing appeared
                (data of the famous historian I.G. Georgi, Narva pastor Fr.-L. Trefurt, pastor L.A. Tsetreus).
            </p>

            <p class = "single-text-article">
                Information about men's clothing was poor at that time: in winter, men wore fur coats, in summer - linen, in autumn - cloth caftans.
                Tumansky wrote: "Before ... their men had their own special clothes, now they dress like Russian peasants."
            </p>




            <p class = "single-text-article">
                Tumansky paid special attention to women's clothing, noting her beauty:
                “Girls and young women with colorful cloth make up the most pleasant clothes for sight,
                and the tin and copper shirkuns (pendants.) make up the kind of music for hearing. ”
            </p>

            <p class = "single-text-article">
                Votic women's clothing is also interesting because it was very important for differences in age groups.
                In the 18th century, neighboring peoples almost no longer had such differences.
                Four groups of Votic women's clothing are distinguished: clothing of girls, young women, older women and old women.

                Vađđa chose beautiful and diverse landscapes for the settlement - hills interspersed with valleys with small streams.
                As far back as the 18th century it was noted that Votes tend to "live in the open and together."
                This trait survived until the middle of the 20th century:
                the houses were crowded, often the villages did not have a strict plan.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                Many researchers believe that the ancient dwelling of Votes was riga, close to Estonian, where there was a living room,
                and riga itself for drying bread, and the stable was under one roof.
                Indeed, as early as 100-200 years ago, votes called the house "riga",
                and nowadays the Votic word "rihi" means a living room.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                In the Votic house, in the old days, there were peculiar traditions of the internal division of the living space,
                accommodating guests and family members.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                Part of the room at the door is the place where the selection of guests took place;
                no one could enter the hut without the permission of the owners.
                The "insignificant" people stayed there,
                and a relative or important person was invited to sit on the back bench
                (by the wall opposite the entrance).
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The table in the house occupied a different position depending on the events:
                on weekdays, on the days of the funeral and commemoration, he stood at the end of the side bench, which was considered the bench of the deceased;
                on wedding days, the table stood in front of the back bench.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                Usually, only men ate at the table, whereas women ate in another place, for example, near the hearth.
                Sometimes they ate in three stages: first men, then women, followed by children.
                Sometimes children ate right on the floor, where they laid a special tablecloth.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                The front corner of the hut diagonally from the furnace was called “humalanurk” (“God's corner”).
                There was a special “colo” locker,
                in which the icons were kept, Easter willows and eggs were laid there with
                branches of Trinity birches and a scrap of hay on St. Ivan's Day - they were fumigated for recovery.
            </p>
            <p class="single-text-article">
                During the summer holidays, floral decorations were brought into the house.
                Juniper was believed to have a special magical power, and was called a “cross” tree,
                since at the top of each cone there is a cruciform fold, and the cross protects against all that is bad.
                On St. George's Day, the landlord tore the juniper from the ground with roots and hung it in the attic,
                that served as protection from troubles and thunderstorms.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                The earliest references to Votic family habits date back to the first half of the 16th century:
                in the message of Archbishop Theodosius, it is indicated that many young people keep brides from five to six months with local people,
                "But there will be a girl or widow of love to them, and they will crown them with those ...
                but will not be of love, and they will send them from themselves."
                Apparently, here we are talking about the so-called “trial” marriage, known in the past among some peoples of Europe.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                The birth of a child usually took place in a bathhouse.
                Sources at the beginning of the 16th century report that “arbuy” sorcerers were called to newborn children,
                who gave the children names, and only then they carried the children to baptize in church.

                In the XVIII century, the folk rite that accompanied the baptism was that the godfather gave the child a cross,
                in return, they received “trousers,” and the child’s father gave the godmother red shoes, the same one gave him money.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                According to historical information, the dying person was put on straw, which was then burned in the yard or street,
                and through this ashes they carried the coffin; they strove to bury it on the same day.
                It is known that even after the transition to Christianity, Votes continued to bury in sacred groves,
                in cemeteries and barrows.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                Votic beliefs are first mentioned in the sources of the XVI century.
                The objects of worship were "forest, and stone, and rivers, and crony, and springs,
                and mountains, and hills, the sun, and the month, and stars, and jezer"
                they made sacrifices — oxen, sheep, and birds.
                Echoes of this veneration have survived until the middle of the 20th century,
                although they are sometimes bizarrely intertwined with Christianity, especially with the cult of St. Elijah,
                whom Votes considered their special protector.
            </p>




            <p class="single-text-article">
                Especially revered national holidays of the vodi were St. Egor (George) Day,
                Midsummer day, the days of St. Ilya (Elijah), Saints Flora and Laurus. On the day of spring Egoriy (April 23th)
                - on the first day of cattle pasture on a pasture - young people made a fire on the edge of the village,
                played, danced and sang.

            <p class="single-text-article">
                On the night of Kupula (Midsummer Day) they burned the old wheel, danced around the fire. Girls necessarily wondered about marriage.
                The Day of Saints Flora and Laurus, the patrons of cattle, was celebrated by the Votes is Russian traditions.
            </p>


            <p class="single-text-article">
                A significant place in the superstitions of the Votes was occupied by conspiracies and magical rites.
                As far back as the 16th century, in case of diseases of people and animals, in case of failures they turned to priests - “arbuys”,
                in the XVIII century - to the sorcerers - “naita”, and in the XX century - to the healers, who knew a huge number of conspiracies.

                The Votic language has never been written, but there has always been a rich oral tradition.
                Back in the middle of the 19th century, Finnish folklorists discovered a treasure of song culture on these lands.
                And although there is very little data on epic poetry,
                For more than a century, it was possible to record many Votic wedding and lyric songs, lamentations and conspiracies.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                For instance, Elias Lönnrot, the world famous collector of folklore and compiler of Kalevala,
                from only one resident of the village of Kotly learned 29 wedding songs.
            </p>

            <p class="single-text-article">
                Songs were often accompanied by playing the kantele, a musical instrument,
                widespread among many Baltic-Finnish peoples and similar to Russian gusli.
